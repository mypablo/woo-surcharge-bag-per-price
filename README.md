## woo-surcharge - bag cost
Because we think Green in my country Greece we charge the bags in market to limit plastic in environment.

So if you need a script to cost a bag per some price in your Woocommerce store you can use this.

Just copy the script of bag-per-price.php 
and paste it into your functions.php of your theme.








This link helps me to complete the script.
